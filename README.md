# PHP Server Setup for Pinfinity Projects

## Setup a Remote Box
First, provision a box from Digital Ocean, and set the domain name to `pinfinityphp`. The domain name is important for the scripts, so if you change it, make sure the setup scripts take that into account.

The instructions for this are roughly the same as those used for [JFDI](https://github.com/FireworksProject/jfdi/blob/master/docs/create-remotebox.md).
